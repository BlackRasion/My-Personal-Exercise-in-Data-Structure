# My-Personal-Exercise-in-Data-Structures
## This is my first repository.
I create it just for learning how to upload a project, and by the way making online backup for my codes. 

All the code is written on **Microsoft Visual C++**, a powerful tool claims to be efficient. But still I can not feel it right now.

## About me
It's a shame to get into github learning so late in college. ðŸ˜ž
Anyway, I wish I could learn more in such a great platform that has so many quality and eye opening resources.
ðŸ«¡ 

I just simply put my all codes here. Maybe I'll organise and update them in the future!ðŸ˜‹
